# Brainlift: AR Game Development Journey

## Inspiration

The core inspiration for this project comes from my desire to build drones designed to assist in natural disasters. I envision drones that can map disaster-stricken areas, deliver essential supplies, locate survivors, and provide real-time data using advanced geospatial technologies. This idea of creating impactful, real-world tech that operates in vast, unpredictable environments sparked my interest in developing a large-scale AR game. By incorporating similar geospatial elements, the game serves as a stepping stone to explore and prototype concepts that could eventually translate to drone applications. At the end of the day, I'm just looking to gain experience by blending fun immersion with practical innovation.

## Project Vision and Selection

From the beginning, my goal was to create an augmented reality (AR) game that transcended typical AR experiences. Most AR applications are limited to small-scale interactions, such as those confined to a living room. In contrast, I envisioned a more expansive and immersive game, incorporating geospatial tagging to enable open-world exploration and real-world integration. This ambitious mindset guided my project selection, prioritizing scalability and spatial awareness over conventional, contained demos.

## Initial Research: Unity Fundamentals

On day one, having no prior experience with Unity, I dedicated 3-4 hours to watching tutorials. This provided a foundational understanding of the engine, including scene management, scripting, and core functionalities. This step was essential to build confidence and prepare for subsequent development phases.

## Exploring Tools and Frameworks

Following the tutorials, I reviewed numerous starter kits, templates, samples, and additional guides to identify the optimal approach. My focus was on popular packages suitable for large-scale AR development. This involved testing options such as AUKI Labs and Niantic platforms. After evaluating documentation and building prototypes, Niantic Lightship emerged as the most accessible choice, allowing for quick setup and functional prototypes with minimal friction.

## Iterative PRD Refinement

Throughout the process, I continuously updated my Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on insights from testing and package evaluations. This adaptive approach ensured alignment between the projectâ€™s vision and practical capabilities. By yesterday, the PRD was finalized, incorporating the best-fit tools and features.

## Current Phase: Implementation

Today, development is in full swing, focusing on building the core elements. This builds directly on the research from day one, testing and PRD adjustments from day two, and the refined plan from yesterday. The progression reflects a structured yet flexible methodology: intensive research, practical evaluation, iteration, and execution.

In summary, this journey emphasizes thoughtful preparation and adaptation to create a groundbreaking geospatial AR game, driven by inspirations from real-world applications like disaster-response drones.
