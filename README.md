## 🎯 Overview

RunnAR transforms outdoor spaces into competitive orienteering courses using augmented reality. Players navigate to virtual control points using only compass bearings and terrain awareness—no GPS breadcrumbs—encouraging real navigation skills like those taught in JROTC programs.

### Key Features

- **🗺️ Real-World AR Navigation**: 5 persistent control points spawned in football field-sized areas
- **🧭 Authentic Tools**: Digital compass and mini-map HUD (no direct GPS paths)
- **⏱️ Competitive Timing**: Beat personal bests with ghost replay system
- **🏃‍♂️ Physical Gameplay**: Encourages real movement and terrain awareness
- **👥 Multiplayer Ready**: 1v1 recapture mode planned (MVP is single-player)
- **🥽 Cross-Platform**: iPhone 15 Pro Max MVP, XREAL One port planned

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Single-Player MVP Mode
- Navigate to 5 AR control points using compass and map
- Collect any 3 out of 5 points to win
- Beat your personal best times
- Ghost replay shows your optimal path
- Escalating difficulty (distance and terrain complexity)

### Planned 1v1 Mode
- Shared AR sessions via Lightship
- Tug-of-war recapture mechanics
- First to control 3/5 points wins
- Strategic positioning and route planning

### JROTC-Inspired Elements
- Sequential navigation to control points
- Timed events with penalties for errors
- Map and compass-only navigation (no GPS assistance)
- Code verification at each checkpoint
- Leadership and skill-building focus

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Engine**: Unity 2022.3 LTS/6
- **AR Framework**: Niantic Lightship ARDK 3.13.0
- **AR Foundation**: 6.0+
- **Target Platform**: iOS 15.0+ (iPhone 15 Pro Max optimized)
- **Persistence**: Lightship Persistent Anchors + GPS hybrid
- **Networking**: Lightship Shared AR (for multiplayer)
- **Storage**: PlayerPrefs (MVP), Firebase (planned)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **Checkpoint Spawner**: Manages 5 persistent AR control points
- **Navigation System**: Digital compass and mini-map HUD
- **Timing Engine**: Per-leg and total run timers with penalties
- **Collection Mechanics**: Code verification and capture system
- **Progression System**: Personal bests and ghost replay

### Safety Features
- AR tracking quality monitoring
- Boundary detection via Lightship semantics
- "Invalid path" penalties (through buildings/water)
- Auto-pause on poor conditions

## 🚀 Getting Started

   cd RunnAR
   ```

2. **Open in Unity**
   - Open Unity Hub
   - Add project from disk
   - Select the RunnAR folder

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Window > Package Manager
   - Add from Git URL: `https://github.com/niantic-lightship/ardk-upm.git`
   - Install AR Foundation 6.0+, TextMeshPro, Input System

4. **Configure Lightship**
   - Get API key from [lightship.dev](https://lightship.dev)
   - Lightship > Settings > Enter API key
   - Enable Niantic Lightship SDK in XR Plug-in Management

5. **iOS Setup**
   - Project Settings > Player > iOS
   - Set Bundle Identifier
   - Add required Usage Descriptions:
